# HepB_elimination_Americas
While participating in the Epidemiology Elective Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I was placed in the Global Immunization Division within the Global Health Center. 
I contributed to a review on [eliminating mother-to-child transmission of Hepatitis B in the Americas, published in the MMWR on July 25th, 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7329a3.htm).
